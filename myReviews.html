<h1>What People Have Said About Me</h1>

<p><b> Kiran Akkineni - Porch.com, Vice President of Analytics</b><br>
"In the six weeks that Curren spent at Porch, he went from not knowing SQL or Excel to producing a usable, in-depth, and repeatable analysis of our marketing programs and user lifetime value. That's a lot to learn and produce in a short amount of time at a fast-growing startup with less support than an intern would find at more tenured companies. Curren powered through, even in exceedingly difficult moments (a rare trait), and succeeded. I look forward to maintaining a relationship and watching his career progress after he finishes school." - Kiran Akkineni</p><br>

<p><b> Beau Nipper - Porch.com, Recruiter</b><br>
"Potential. That's what Curren has. Curren joined our internship program for the summer of 2014. During his time with Porch, he showed passion, drive, and a hard work ethic. Very impressed with his analytical prowess and acumen at such a young age. Excited to see the many accomplishments this young man will have. Very much hoping to work with him again one day." - Beau Nipper</p><br>

<p><b> Drew Hackleman - WhitePages.com, Director of Data Strategy and Aquisitions </b><br>
"Curren was an outstanding Intern for WhitePages in the Summer of 2013. Working within our Product and Engineering teams, Curren was exposed to a bevy of different projects and he handled them all with an energetic and professional approach. In his time here he worked with four different coding languages, built data compilation processes and did competitive analysis for current and potential business partners, and he has a unique skill set that allows him to be successful in each of these different arenas. It was an absolute pleasure working with Curren over the Summer and I would welcome the opportunity to work with him again in the future." - Drew Hackleman </p><br>

<p><b> Doug Aley - Zulily, Vice President of Product and Corporate Development</b><br>
"Curren's got more energy and smarts at a young age than most I've met. He's a fantastic worker, a joy to be around and a really quick study. Very much looking forward to watching his career and hopefully getting a chance to work with him again." - Doug Aley </p><br>

<p><b> Kevin Walsh - Zulily, Associate Marketing Manager</b><br>
"I had the good fortune to meet and work with Curren over the summer while he interned with our product marketing team. Always curious about the world around him, Curren brought to the table both great questions and well considered ideas for improving this or that. Curren was always open to learn new things, and was applying those same lessons to his work in no time. Extraordinarily clever, curious, and ambitious, Curren doubtlessly has a successful and fascinating career ahead of him." - Kevin Walsh </p><br>
