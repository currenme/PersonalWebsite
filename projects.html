<h1>Selected Programming Projects</h1>


<p><b> Battleship </b><br>
I created a Battleship game in Java. This game allows a user to play individually against a computer, or for two users to play against each other, either on the same machine or on different machines through networked interactions. To make this game, I wrote over 3600 lines of code and used important concepts such as networking, multithreading, and GUIs.<br>

<p><b> Poker Island </b> (with Adam Mann, Utkash Dubey, Emile Indik, and Noel Trivedi)<br>
In 6700 lines of Java code we provide a fully functional and immersive poker game experience that allows multiple users to play against each other from separate computers. We created a responsive, rich graphical game experience, use combinatorics to optimize hand calculations, store hand histories, and allow for differnt gameplay functionalities.<br>

<p><b> MoneySmart </b> (with William Lin)<br>
MoneySmart is an interactive web application made by myself and my friend William Lin during the 35-hour USC Hackation HackSC (Spring 2014). MoneySmart provides interactive retirement and savings calculators and predictive models for users. We built this from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the open-source Chart.JS library.<br>
